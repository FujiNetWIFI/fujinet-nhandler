Nn: - Change the current default
network drive.

Usage:

Nn:

Where n is required and n denotes a
device number 1-4.

After changing the default network
drive, the command prompt is updated
to reflect the new default network
drive.

Note: No check is made regarding the
status of the mount point for the new
default network drive. That is, it is
possible to switch to a network drive
that has no assigned mount point.
