AUTORUN - Assign or query a batch
file to execute automatically
after a cold start upon NOS entry.

Usage:

AUTORUN path/filename
or
AUTORUN ?

Example:

AUTORUN TNFS://192.168.1.20/GO.BAT

to clear the AUTORUN entry, use:

AUTORUN ""

to query the current entry, use:

AUTORUN ?

to bypass executing AUTORUN:

At boot, when the FUJINET NOS banner
appears -or- when switching from 
BASIC to DOS the first time, 
hold the OPTION console switch.

Note: The AUTORUN entry is stored in
the appkey file "/FujiNet/
db790000.key" on the FujiNet's SD 
card. Therefore, AUTORUN requires a 
FAT32-formatted SD card to be
installed in the FujiNet device.
