736-737     02E0-02E1      RUNAD

Used by DOS for the run address read
from the disk sector one or from a
binary file. Upon completion of any
binary load, control will normally
be passed back to the DOS menu.
However, DOS can be forced to pass
control to any specific address by
storing that address here. If RUNAD
is set to 40960 ($A000), then the
left cartridge (BASIC if inserted)
will be called when the program is
booted.

With DOS 1.0, if you POKE the
address of your binary load file
here, the file will be automatically
run upon using the DOS Binary Load
(selection L). Using DOS 1.0's
append (/A) option when saving a
binary file to disk, you can cause
the load address POKEd here to be
saved with the data. In DOS 2.0, you
may specify the initialization and
the run address with the program
name when you save it to disk (i.e.,
GAME.OBJ,2000,4FFF,4F00,4000). DOS
2.0 uses the /A option to merge
files. In order to prevent your
binary files from running
automatically upon loading in DOS
2.0, use the /N appendage to the
file name when loading the file.

For users of CompuServe, there is an
excellent little BASIC program (with
machine language subroutines) to
create autoboot files, chain machine
language files with BASIC and to add
an 850 autoboot file in the Popular
Electronics Magazine (PEM) access
area. It is available free for
downloading.
