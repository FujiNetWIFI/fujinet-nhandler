30          001E          PBUFSZ

Print buffer size of printer record
for current mode. Normal buffer size
and line size equals 40 bytes;
double-width print equals 20 bytes
(most printers use their own control
codes for expanded print); sideways
printing equals 29 bytes (Atari 820
printer only). Printer status
request equals four. PBUFSZ is
initialized to 40. The printer
handler checks to see if the same
value is in PBPNT and, if so, sends
the contents of the buffer to the
printer.
