Printer timeout, called every
printer status request. Initialized
to 30, which represents 32 seconds
(the value is 64 seconds per 60
increments in this register);
typical timeout for the Atari 825
printer is five seconds. The value
is set by your printer handler
software. It is updated after each
printer status request operation.
It gets the specific timeout status
from location 748 ($2EC), which is
loaded there by SIO.

The new "B" type OS ROMs have
apparently solved the problem of
timeout that haunted the "A" ROMs;
you saw it when the printer or the
disk drive periodically went to
sleep (timed out) for a few seconds,
causing severe anxiety attacks in
the owners who thought their Ataris
had just mysteriously died. This is
compounded when one removes a disk
from the drive, believing the I/O
process to be finished--only to have
the drive start up again after the
timeout and trying to write to or
read from a nonexistent disk.
Usually both the system and the user
crash simultaneously at this point.
See the appendix for more
information on the new ROMs.
