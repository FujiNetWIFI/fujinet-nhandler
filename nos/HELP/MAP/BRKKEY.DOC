17          0011          BRKKEY

Zero means the BREAK key is pressed;
any other number means it's not. A
BREAK during I/O returns 128 ($80).
Monitored by both keyboard, display,
cassette and screen handlers. See
location 16 ($A) for hints on
disabling the BREAK key. The latest
editions of OS provide for a proper
vector for BREAK interrupts.  The
BREAK key abort status code is stored
in STATUS (48; $30).  It is also
checked during all I/O and scroll/draw
routines. During the keyboard handler
routine, the status code is stored in
DSTAT (76; $4C). BRKKEY is turned off
at powerup. BREAK key abort status is
flagged by setting BIT 7 of 53774
($D20E). See the note on the BREAK key
vector, above.
