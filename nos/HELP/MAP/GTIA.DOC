GTIA (or CTIA) is a special television
interface chip designed exclusively
for the Atari to process the video
signal. ANTIC controls most of the
C/GTIA chip functions. The GTIA shifts
the display by one-half color clock
off what the CTIA displays, so it may
display a different color than the
CTIA in the same piece of software.
However, this shift allows players and
playfields to overlap perfectly.

There is no text window available in
GTIA modes, but you can create a
defined area on your screen with
either a DLI (see COMPUTE!, September
1982) or by POKEing the GTIA mode
number into location 87 ($57), POKEing
703 with four and then setting the
proper bits in location 623 ($26F) for
that mode. Only in the former method
will you be able to get a readable
screen, however. In the latter you
will only create a four line,
scrolling, unreadable window. You will
be able to input and output as with
any normal text window; you just won't
be able to read it! GTIA, by the way,
apparently stands for "George's
Television Interface Adapter." Whoever
George is, thanks, but what is CTIA?
See the OS User's Manual, the Hardware
Manual, De Re Atari and COMPUTE!, July
1982 to September 1982, for more
information.
