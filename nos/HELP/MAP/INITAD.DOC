Initialization address read from the
disk. An autoboot file must load an
address value into either RUNAD
above or INITAD. The code pointed to
by INITAD will be run as soon as
that location is loaded. The code
pointed to by RUNAD will be executed
only after the entire load process
has been completed. To return
control to DOS after the execution
of your program, end your code with
an RTS instruction.
