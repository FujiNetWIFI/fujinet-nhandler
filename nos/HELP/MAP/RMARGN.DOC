83          0053          RMARGN

Right margin of the text screen
initialized to 39 ($27). Both
locations 82 and 83 are
user-alterable, but ignored in all
GRAPHICS modes except zero and the
text window.  Margins work with the
text window and blackboard mode and
are reset to their default values by
pressing RESET. Margins have no
effect on scrolling or the printer.
However, DELETE LINE and INSERT LINE
keys delete or insert 40 character
lines (or delete one program line),
which always start at the left
margin and wrap around the screen
edge back to the left margin again.
The right margin is ignored in the
process. Also, logical lines are
always three physical lines no
matter how long or short you make
those lines.

The beep you hear when you are
coming to the end of the logical
line works by screen position
independent of the margins. Try
setting your left margin at 25 (POKE
82,25) and typing a few lines of
characters. Although you have just a
few characters beyond 60, the buzzer
will still sound on the third line
of text.
