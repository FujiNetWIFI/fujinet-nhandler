77          004D          ATRACT

Attract mode timer and flag. Attract
mode rotates colors on your screen
at low luminance levels when the
computer is on but no keyboard input
is read for a long time (seven to
nine minutes).  This helps to save
your TV screen from "burn-out"
damage suffered from being left on
and not used. It is set to zero by
IRQ whenever a key is pressed,
otherwise incremented every four
seconds by VBLANK (see locations
18 - 20; $12 - $14). When the value
in ATRACT reaches 127 ($7F), it is
then set to 254 ($FE) until attract
mode is terminated. This sets the
flag to reduce the luminance and
rotate the colors when the Atari is
sitting idle.  POKE with 128 ($80)
to see this effect immediately: it
normally takes seven to nine minutes
to enable the attract mode. The OS
cannot "attract" color generated by
DLI's, although your DLI routine
can, at a loss of time.

Joysticks alone will not reset
location 77 to zero. You will have
to add a POKE 77,0 to your program
periodically or frequently call in a
subroutine to prevent the Atari from
entering attract mode if you are not
using any keyboard input.
