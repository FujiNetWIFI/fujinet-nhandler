212-217          D4-D9          FR0

Floating point register zero; holds
a six-byte internal form of the FP
number. The value at locations 212
and 213 are used to return a
two-byte hexadecimal value in the
range of zero to 65536 ($FFFF) to
the BASIC program (low byte in 212,
high byte in 213). The floating
point package, if used, requires all
locations from 212 to 255. All six
bytes of FR0 can be used by a
machine language routine, provided
FR0 isn't used and no FP functions
are used by that routine. To use 16
bit values in FP, you would place
the two bytes of the number into the
least two bytes of FR0 (212, 213;
$D4, $D5), and then do a JSR to
$D9AA (55722), which will convert
the integer to its FP
representation, leaving the result
in FR0. To reverse this operation,
do a JSR to $D9D2 (55762).
